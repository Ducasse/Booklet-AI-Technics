!! Naive Bayes Classifier

Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC) is a very simple yet powerful algorithm of machine learning. It is a generative model, which means that it is trying to learn the joint probability distribution $$P(X, Y)$$ of input $$X$$ and output $$Y$$.

!!! How does it work?

$$P(Y|X) = \frac{P(Y)P(Y|X)}{P(X)}$$
$P(Y|X) = \frac{P(Y)P(Y|X)}{P(X)}$
\[ P(Y|X) = \frac{P(Y)P(Y|X)}{P(X)} \]
